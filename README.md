# Node Js essentials: why you should know how the engine works <br/>
## Each major browser vendor has its own engine.<br />
1. Mozilla Firefox has Spidermonkey,<br />
2. Microsoft Edge has Chakra/ChakraCore,<br />
3. Apple Safari has JavaScriptCore,<br />
4. Google Chrome uses V8, which is also the engine of Node.js<br />

# Idea behind modern engines is to combine the best of both worlds:<br />
1. Fast application startup of the interpreter.<br />
2. Fast execution of the compiler.<br />

## Combined Forces: Interpreter and Compiler<br />
1. Modern JavaScript engines combine the benefits of interpreter and compiler: Fast application startup and fast code execution.<br />

2. Inline Caching is a powerful optimisation technique. It works best when only a single object shape passes to the optimised function.<br />

3. My drastic example showed the effects of Inline Caching’s different types and the performance penalties of megamorphic caches.<br />

4. Using JavaScript classes is good practice. Static typed transpilers, like TypeScript, make monomorphic IC’s more likely.<br />


# NodeJS101 Project  <br />
## Steps to install Node Js
$node --version <br />
$npm --version <br />
$node <br />
$open up a folder in visual code <br />
$npm init  #create package.json <br />
$npm install uuid  # create uuid <br />
$npm install --save-dev nodemon  # download devleopment dependency <br />
$npm install -D nodemon  # download devleopment dependency <br />
[above 2 are identical] <br />

# Git Commands Types <br />
### GIT CHEAT SHEET
1. CONFIGURE TOOLING - Configure user information for all local repositories <br />
```js
$ git config --global user.name "[name]" =>Sets the name you want atached to your commit transactions
$ git config --global user.email "[email address]" =>Sets the email you want atached to your commit transactions
$ git config --global color.ui auto =>Enables helpful colorization of command line output
```
2. CREATE REPOSITORIES - Start a new repository or obtain one from an existing URL <br />
```js
$ git init [project-name] =>Creates a new local repository with the specified name
$ git clone [url] =>Downloads a project and its entire version history
```
3. MAKE CHANGES - Review edits and craf a commit transaction <br />
```js
$ git status => Lists all new or modified files to be commited
$ git add [file] =>Snapshots the file in preparation for versioning
$ git reset [file] =>Unstages the file, but preserve its contents
$ git diff =>Shows file differences not yet staged
$ git diff --staged =>Shows file differences between staging and the last file version
$ git commit -m "[descriptive message]" =>Records file snapshots permanently in version history
```
4. GROUP CHANGES - Name a series of commits and combine completed efforts <br />
```js
$ git branch =>Lists all local branches in the current repository
$ git branch [branch-name] =>Creates a new branch
$ git checkout [branch-name] =>Switches to the specified branch and updates the working directory
$ git merge [branch] =>Combines the specified branch’s history into the current branch
$ git branch -d [branch-name] =>Deletes the specified branch
```
5. REFACTOR FILENAMES - Relocate and remove versioned files <br />
```js
$ git rm [file]  => Deletes the file from the working directory and stages the deletion
$ git rm --cached [file] =>Removes the file from version control but preserves the file locally
$ git mv [file-original] [file-renamed] =>Changes the file name and prepares it for commit
```
6. SUPPRESS TRACKING - Exclude temporary files and paths <br />
```js
*.log
build/
temp-*
=>a text file named .gitignore suppresses accidental versioning of files and paths matching the specified paterns
$ git ls-files --other --ignored --exclude-standard
=> Lists all ignored files in this project
```
7. SAVE FRAGMENTS - Shelve and restore incomplete changes <br />
```js
$ git stash => Temporarily stores all modified tracked files
$ git stash list =>Lists all stashed changesets
$ git stash pop => Restores the most recently stashed files
$ git stash drop =>Discards the most recently stashed changeset
```
8. REVIEW HISTORY - Browse and inspect the evolution of project files <br />
```js
$ git log =>Lists version history for the current branch
$ git log --follow [file] =>Lists version history for a file, including renames
$ git diff [first-branch]...[second-branch] =>Shows content differences between two branches
$ git show [commit] => Outputs metadata and content changes of the specified commit
```
9. REDO COMMITS - Erase mistakes and craf replacement history <br />
```js
$ git reset [commit]
Undoes all commits afer [commit], preserving changes locally
$ git reset --hard [commit]
Discards all history and changes back to the specified commit
```
10. SYNCHRONIZE CHANGES - Register a repository bookmark and exchange version history <br />
```js
$ git fetch [bookmark] => Downloads all history from the repository bookmark
$ git merge [bookmark]/[branch] =>Combines bookmark’s branch into current local branch
$ git push [alias] [branch] =>Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub
$ git pull =>Downloads bookmark history and incorporates changes
```
